# SerenityVRProject1

Through the ever expanding array of technologies that allow us to traverse space, 
some problems are still evident and have huge impacts on astronauts both physically and psychologically. 
Because of the lack of gravity, muscle loss and bone density loss increase, both causing additional complications; 
the prolonged seclusion in space away from family and society can cause anxiety and depression. 
SerenityVR is here to lighten the load. Although astronauts are in a confined space, they donâ€™t have to feel it. Using Unity, 
Oculus and the Myo armband, SerenityVR brings the user into immersive and interactive environments where they can both exercise 
through gameplay as well as feel serenity through calming visualizations. SerenityVR not only works for space, 
but in any industry or place that require a person to be in seclusion or in confined spaces.
